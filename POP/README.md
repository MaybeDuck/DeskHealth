Desk Health is a Google Chrome Extension, designed to enforce healthy desk habits for students and professionals. When you work on your computer, you want to ensure you are being as productive as possible. 

Studies have shown us that letting your brain rest for a 15-minute break leads to roughly an hour of extremely productive work. One of DeskHealth’s features is its “Break Reminder”. The Break Reminder is a 15-minute countdown timer to remind users of when they should take breaks, and for how long.  In DeskHealths settings, users can set reminder periods for how often they want to be reminded to take a break. 

Just as important as keeping the brain rested, is keeping the body hydrated. Even mild dehydration can impact cognitive function. DeskHealths “Water Reminder” reminds users at specific times of the day to keep drinking water. This is taken a step further by also allowing users to make goals for their water intake and be able to see where they should be to meet those goals.  

Finally, bouncing back and forth between the same four to six tabs can get boring after a while. DeskHealth uses its “Random Dog Popup” feature to add a little spice to the user's work experience. Users can adjust in the settings the level of how often they want to give a Random Dog Popup on a scale between 1 to 5. The Popup will select a random photo from its Dogy database to show the user after a certain amount of tab usage. Who doesn't love random photos of dogs?
